Main codes for the paper 'Apnoea suppresses brain activity in infants' (bioRxiv DOI: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.16.580547)

Repository contains codes:
- compute_Hilbert_and_stats: gets EEG amplitudes for apnoeas and breathing pauses. Also performs time-frequency statistics to check if these amplitudes are different compared with control periods.
- linear_models_eeg_physiology: linear models to test whether the EEG amplitude changes are associated with (1) heart rate, (2) oxygen saturation, (3) pause duration, (4) age, and (5) sleep state.
